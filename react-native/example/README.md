# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Generate the Rust Bindings

> **Note**: This project can't be run on Windows currently in development. Please use WSL2, Linux or macOS.

You will need to generate bindings for the platform you are targeting. This need to be done within the root of the project `/react-native`.

You can do this by running the following command:
**Android**: `yarn run ubrn:android`
**iOS**: `yarn run ubrn:ios`

## Step 2: Run the App

> **Note**: You will need to set the **STADIA_API_KEY** environment variable to your API key before running the app. Or replace the current layer being used with your own.

1. Open a terminal in the root of the project `/react-native` and run: `yarn run example`. This will start the Metro bundler and will prompt which platform you want to run the app on.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
