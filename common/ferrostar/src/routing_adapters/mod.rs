//! The bridge between routing engines and Ferrostar in high-level platform frameworks.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - Important traits for framework implementers
//! - Generic HTTP request generation and response parsing for common routing APIs
//!
//! If you're reading this module documentation,
//! you are probably bringing Ferrostar to a new platform
//! where no high-level library like the native iOS and Android `FerrostarCore` exists.
//!
//! The first thing you should know is that
//! there isn't anything inherently special about the types at the root of this module.
//! These types are designed to be integral to higher-level platform libraries
//! (like those for iOS and Android) to ensure extensibility.
//! But they aren't used anywhere else in the crate.
//!
//! If you're implementing Ferrostar bindings for a new platform,
//! have a look at the [iOS implementation](https://github.com/stadiamaps/ferrostar/blob/main/apple/Sources/FerrostarCore/FerrostarCore.swift),
//! particularly how the initializer requires a [`RouteProvider`](https://github.com/stadiamaps/ferrostar/blob/main/apple/Sources/FerrostarCore/RouteProvider.swift).
//! All routing in the `FerrostarCore` class goes through this,
//! with the heavy lifting done by either a [`RouteAdapter`] or a custom provider
//! (native arbitrary code).
//! We suggest that other platforms follow a similar approach to maximize extensibility.
//!
//! If you're doing a direct integration calling this library directly,
//! you can probably go straight to the submodules for integrations with major routing engines
//! and then construct a [`NavigationController`](crate::navigation_controller::NavigationController)
//! with a route and configuration.
//! PRs are welcome for any routing API with an open specification (even if it's a commercial offering).
//!
//! Ferrostar also fully supports proprietary and on-device routing.
//! All you need to do is convert your routes into Ferrostar [Route]s,
//! and nothing in this module is strictly required to do that.
