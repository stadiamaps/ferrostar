//! Tools for deciding when the user has sufficiently deviated from a route.
//!
//! The types in this module are designed around route deviation detection as a single responsibility:
//!
//! While the most common use for this is triggering route recalculation,
//! the decision to reroute (or display an overlay on screen, or any other action) lies with higher levels.
//!
//! For example, on iOS and Android, the `FerrostarCore` class is in charge of deciding
//! when to kick off a new route request.
//! Similarly, you may observe this in your own UI layer and display an overlay under certain conditions.
//!
//! When architecting a Ferrostar core integration for a new platform,
//! we suggest enforcing a similar separation of concerns.
