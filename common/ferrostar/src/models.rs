//! Quick tour:
//! - [`Route`]: Common notion of what a route is; You can go top-down from here if you're curious.
//! - [`Waypoint`]: Points that a user is intending to traverse; interesting because there are multiple kinds of them.
//! - [`SpokenInstruction`] and [`VisualInstruction`]: Audiovisual prompts as the user progresses through the route.
