## Basemaps

You need basemaps for most (but not all!) useful navigation apps.

The included UI components are all based on MapLibre,
which supports the Mapbox Vector Tile specification.
Here are a few popular vendors:

* [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/)
* [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com/) (note that pricing is different for accessing tiles directly rather than using their proprietary SDKs)
* [Jawg](https://www.jawg.io/)
* [MapTiler](https://maptiler.com/)

At the time of this writing, all basemap vendors offer free API keys for evaluation use.
