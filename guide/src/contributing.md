# Contributing to Ferrostar

We're stoked that you're interested in working on Ferrostar!
This contribution guide will get you started developing in no time,
and provides some guidelines to follow when submitting an issue or PR.

## How we communicate

It is a good idea to discuss large proposed changes
before proceeding to an issue ticket or PR.
The maintainers and active contributors use the following forums:

* For informal chat discussions, visit the `#ferrostar` channel in the OSMUS Slack.
  You can get an invite to the workspace at [slack.openstreetmap.us](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/).
* For larger discussions where it would be desirable to have wider input / a less ephemeral record,
	you can open an issue or discussion on GitHub.
	
### Issues vs Discussions? 

If you have a pretty clear feature request or bug report,
just open a GitHub Issue.

If it’s a bit more open-ended, consider [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/stadiamaps/ferrostar/discussions) first.

Discussions are organized into two categories: engineering RFDs and Q&A.
Q&A should be self-explanatory; if you have a question about something,
need help with an integration, etc., then post it here!
Engineering RFDs are designed to start a discussion about the best way to do something,
share research, and discuss larger projects before the issue stage.
If you’re curious what an RFD is,

## Pull Request Tips

To speed up reviews,
it's helpful if you enable edits from maintainers when opening the PR.
In the case of minor changes, formatting, or style nitpicks,
we can make edits directly to avoid wasting your time.
In order to enable edits from maintainers, **you'll need to make the PR from a fork owned by an individual**,
not an organization.
GitHub org-owned forks lack this flexibility.

If your change is visual in nature and isn’t covered by snapshot tests,
before+after screenshots or videos are *greatly* appreciated!
